Coding Interview Preparation Riddles from FreeCodeCamp site I solved.
I used JavaScript on Atom software (see Atom.io).

To run file, open your Atom software, open the file, and then press ctrl+shift+b to execute.
You will see result on terminal.


The terminal is inside the Atom software, at the buttom of the screen.
